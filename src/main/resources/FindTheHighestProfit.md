Find the Highest Profit - New Grad
https://algo.monster/problems/find_the_highest_profit

A Company has several suppliers for its products. For each of the products, the stock is represented by a list of a number of items for each supplier. As items are purchased, the supplier raises the price by 1 per item purchased. Let's assume Amazon's profit on any single item is the same as the number of items the supplier has left.

For example, if a supplier has 4 items, Amazon's profit on the first item sold is 4, then 3, then 2 and the profit of the last one is 1.

Given a list where each value in the list is the number of the item at a given supplier and also given the number of items to be ordered, write an algorithm to find the highest profit that can be generated for the given product.

Notes: -10 is smaller than -1. If multiple people have the smallest negative balance, return the list in alphabetical order. If nobody has a negative balance, return the list consisting of the string "Nobody has a negative balance".

Write an algorithm to find who in the group has the smallest negative balance.

Input
The input consists of three arguments:

numSuppliers: an integer representing the number of suppliers

inventory: a list of long integers representing the value of the item at a given supplier

order: a long integer representing the number of items to be ordered.

Output
Return a long integer representing the highest profit that can be generated for the given product.

Constraints
1 <= numSuppliers <= 10^5

1 <= inventory[i] <= 10 ^ 5

0 <= i < numSuppliers

1 <= orders <= sum of inventory

Examples
Example 1:
Input:
numSuppliers = 2

inventory = [3,5]

order = 6

Output: 19
Explanation:
There are two suppliers, one with inventory 3 and the other with inventory 5, and 6 items were ordered The maximum profit is made by selling 1 for 5, 1 for 4, and 2 at 3 and 2 at 2 units profit. The two suppliers are left with a unit of product each. The maximum profit generated is 5 + 4 + 2*3 + 2*2 = 19.



Maximizing profit: Green represents units purchased by the marketer, Red squares are products retained by the suppliers. Blue squares are empty.

Example 2:
Input:
numSuppliers = 5

inventory = [2, 8, 4, 10, 6]

order = 20

Output: 110
Explanation:
There are 5 sellers with inventory = [2, 8, 4, 10, 6] and Items ordered are 20. The marketer will purchase items from any supplier until they have only 2 units left.



Green represents units purchased by the marketer, Red squares are products retained by the suppliers. Blue squares are empty.

The maximum profit generated is 10 + 9 + 2*8 + 2*7 + 3*6 + 3*5+ 4*4 + 4*3 = 10 + 9 + 16 + 14 + 18 + 15 + 16 + 12 = 110.
